## Key Components

### Configuration System (`config.py`)

```python
from data_analysis_tool.config import get_config

config = get_config()
api_timeout = config.get('api.timeout', 30)  # Fallback to 30
database_url = config.get('database.url')    # From env or config file
```

**Configuration Hierarchy** (highest priority first):

1. Environment variables (e.g., `API_TIMEOUT`)
2. Configuration file (`config.json`)
3. Default values

### Security-Aware Logging (`logger.py`)

```python
from data_analysis_tool.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Processing user request", extra={
    'user_id': 'user123',      # ‚úÖ Safe to log
    'password': 'secret123'    # ‚ùå Automatically masked
})
```

**Security Features**:

- Automatic masking of sensitive fields (password, token, key, secret)
- Configurable allowed fields for logging
- Consistent formatting across all modules

### Environment Management

The template includes comprehensive environment variable management:

```bash
# .env.example shows required and optional variables
# Required variables
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/mydb

# OPTIONAL
# Optional feature flags
FEATURE_ENABLED=false
```

**Environment Checking**:

- Validates required variables on startup
- Logs missing required variables as warnings
- Logs optional variables as info
- Supports inline documentation

### Testing Infrastructure

```python
# tests/conftest.py provides useful fixtures
def test_my_feature(mock_env_vars, temp_dir, sample_config_file):
    # Test with isolated environment
    pass
```

**Test Features**:

- Environment variable mocking
- Temporary directory creation
- Sample configuration files
- Isolated test environments

## Development Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
cd your-new-project
pip install -e ".[dev]"              # Install in development mode
cp .env.example .env                 # Create environment file
# Edit .env with your values
```

### 2. Development

```bash
python your-project.py               # Run main application
python -m pytest                    # Run tests
python -m pytest --cov              # Run with coverage
```

### 3. Configuration

Edit `config.json` for default settings:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "timeout": 30,
    "base_url": "https://api.example.com"
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "INFO",
    "format": "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
  }
}
```

Override with environment variables:

```bash
export API_TIMEOUT=60
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

## Project Types

This template supports multiple project types, each tailored for specific use cases:

### Library

- **Standard Python package structure** with modern packaging (pyproject.toml)
- **Importable modules and functions** with proper package initialization
- **Comprehensive configuration management** with environment variable support
- **Security-aware logging** with configurable levels and safe output
- **Testing framework** with pytest and coverage reporting
- **Code quality tools** (black, flake8, mypy) with sensible defaults
- **Development workflow** with optional GitHub Actions, Docker, and pre-commit hooks

### CLI Application

All library features plus:
- **Click-based command-line interface** with rich help formatting
- **Rich console output** with tables, colors, and progress indicators
- **Automatic entry point** installation via `pip install`
- **Professional CLI structure** with commands, options, and error handling
- **Built-in commands**: `status`, `hello`, `info` with extensible command structure

Example CLI usage:
```bash
# After installation
my-tool --help
my-tool status
my-tool hello "World" --count 3

# Or run directly
python run_my_project.py --help
```

### Future Expansions

Planned additions include:

- **API Server type**: FastAPI-based REST services with proper routing and documentation
- **Microservice type**: Containerized services with health checks and service discovery

Each type builds upon the core library foundation while adding specialized dependencies, entry points, and starter files.

## Best Practices

## Template Evolution

This template is a living project that evolves with my Python development journey. As I discover new patterns, tools, or techniques that improve my development workflow, I'll incorporate them here.

### Current Focus Areas
- **Better testing patterns** - Exploring property-based testing and test automation
- **Development tooling** - Integrating more helpful pre-commit hooks and formatting tools  
- **Documentation** - Finding better ways to maintain project documentation
- **Performance** - Adding profiling and performance monitoring patterns

### Future Considerations
- Container deployment patterns (when I work more with Docker/Kubernetes)
- API design patterns (as I build more REST APIs)
- Database integration patterns (when projects need persistence)
- Monitoring and observability (for production deployments)

> **Note**: Features get added when I actually need them in my projects, not just because they're trendy. This keeps the template practical and focused.

## Development Approach

This template was developed collaboratively with AI as a coding partner, bringing together human experience and AI perspective to create something better than either could build alone. The patterns and decisions remain under continuous review to ensure they serve real project needs.

I believe in treating AI as a respectful collaborator - like working alongside a friend with a unique perspective. All design decisions ultimately reflect my development philosophy and real-world project experience.
