**Production-ready project scaffolding with security and quality foundations**

A [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for Python projects that includes professional patterns I've found useful: security-conscious logging, hierarchical configuration, and modern development practices.

> **🎯 Goal**: Skip the repetitive setup work. Get Python projects with good security and testing practices built-in.

> **🏗️ What This Provides**: A solid foundation with opinionated choices about logging, configuration, and CLI tooling. More comprehensive than basic templates, but not a complete framework.

> **📝 Approach**: Features are added based on real project needs, not theoretical completeness. Patterns evolve as I learn better ways to structure Python applications.

## Key Components

### Configuration System (`config.py`)

```python
from data_analysis_tool.config import get_config

config = get_config()
api_timeout = config.get('api.timeout', 30)  # Fallback to 30
database_url = config.get('database.url')    # From env or config file
```

**Configuration Hierarchy** (highest priority first):

1. Environment variables (e.g., `API_TIMEOUT`)
2. Configuration file (`config.json`)
3. Default values

### Security-Aware Logging (`logger.py`)

```python
from data_analysis_tool.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Processing user request", extra={
    'user_id': 'user123',      # ✅ Safe to log
    'password': 'secret123'    # ❌ Automatically masked
})
```

**Security Features**:

- Automatic masking of sensitive fields (password, token, key, secret)
- Configurable allowed fields for logging
- Consistent formatting across all modules

### Environment Management

The template includes comprehensive environment variable management:

```bash
# .env.example shows required and optional variables
# Required variables
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/mydb

# OPTIONAL
# Optional feature flags
FEATURE_ENABLED=false
```

**Environment Checking**:

- Validates required variables on startup
- Logs missing required variables as warnings
- Logs optional variables as info
- Supports inline documentation

### Testing Infrastructure

```python
# tests/conftest.py provides useful fixtures
def test_my_feature(mock_env_vars, temp_dir, sample_config_file):
    # Test with isolated environment
    pass
```

**Test Features**:

- Environment variable mocking
- Temporary directory creation
- Sample configuration files
- Isolated test environments

## Project Types & Examples

## Development Philosophy

### **Practical Over Perfect**
This template focuses on **real-world usefulness** rather than theoretical completeness:
- **Security practices** that actually matter for business applications
- **Professional tooling** that users expect from quality CLI tools
- **Testing patterns** that catch real bugs and maintain code quality
- **Configuration management** that works in different deployment environments

### **Opinionated But Flexible**
I've made specific choices about tools and patterns based on experience:
- **Ruff + mypy** for code quality (fast, comprehensive)
- **pytest** for testing (excellent ecosystem)
- **Click + Rich** for CLI tools (professional, user-friendly)
- **YAML/JSON** for configuration (widely supported, readable)

These choices reduce decision fatigue while remaining adaptable to different needs.

### **Collaborative Development**
This template benefits from **AI-human collaboration**:
- **Human experience** - Real project challenges and practical requirements
- **AI analysis** - Pattern optimization, edge case identification, code quality
- **Continuous refinement** - Regular review and improvement based on usage

The result is better than either perspective alone could produce.
