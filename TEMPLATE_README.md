# ty10ng's Python Project Template

My personal [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for Python projects. This is a living template that evolves as I learn and develop better patterns for Python development.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter gh:ty10ng/python-template
```

## What You Get

- **Security-conscious logging** with automatic sensitive data masking
- **Flexible configuration management** with environment variable support
- **Testing foundation** with pytest and helpful fixtures
- **Project structure options** for libraries, CLI tools, APIs, and microservices

## Philosophy

This template reflects my current understanding of Python best practices. It includes patterns I've found useful in my own projects and will continue to evolve as I discover new tools and techniques.

Features get added when I actually need them, not just because they're trendy. This keeps the template practical and focused on real-world use cases.
